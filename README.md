# econ-ark-tools
General tools for econ-ark, packaged up

## Virtual

This directory explains options for creating an Econ-ARK Virtual Machine that you can run on a host computer. Naturally, because your computer's resources will be shared with the VM, both your regular processes (email, etc) and the Econ-ARK machine's process may be slow.

## Metal

This directory explains how to take an existing computer and convert it to have the Econ-ARK system installed in place of whatever OS you may already have. Considerably faster and more efficient than the Virtual option. If you have a disued old computer, you might try this.

## Hybrid

If you have a compatible version of Linux running in any form (either you already have a linux computer, or you have an existing installation of linux in a VM on your host computer), you can add the Econ-ARK system to that machine (virtual or real).
